	"game:sprinklersmod-quickstart-text": "The Sprinklers Mod allows crafting of Sprinklers which allow for automatic watering of acres.\n\nThese Sprinklers will periodically water all nearby farmland blocks in an (configurable) interval. For them to be able to do this, they need to be filled with water from a watering can. The tooltip will show the current amount of stored water. If water is filled up and the average moisture of the surrounding farmland is smaller than 80%, the sprinkler will activate and consume some of its water to add 5% moisture to each block. This will happen until the 80% threshold is reached.\n\nA small warning: The continual search for waterable blocks in the Sprinklers range might cause performance issue. Use this mod with caution.\n\nThere are 3 types of sprinklers:\n\n<a href=\"handbooksearch://Bronze-Sprinkler\">Bronze-Sprinkler</a> - 2 Blocks Radius\n<a href=\"handbooksearch://Iron-Sprinkler\">Iron-Sprinkler</a> - 4 Blocks Radius\n<a href=\"handbooksearch://Steel-Sprinkler\">Steel-Sprinkler</a> - 6 Blocks Radius\n\n\nConfig Parameteres:\n\nxyzSprinklerRange =&gt; Determines the watering radius for the corresponding Sprinkler type\n\nwaterConsumption =&gt; Multiplies the water consumption per activation. Formula: 0,1 Liters * waterConsumption\n\nminIntervalInMillis =&gt; Defines a base value for how often (in milliseconds) the Sprinklers should activate. To prevent lag, each Sprinkler will be added up to 5 seconds of delay on top of this value."
